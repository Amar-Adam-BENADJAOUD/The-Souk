        The Souk is an online marketplace designed for buying and selling second-hand items between individuals.
        The platform offers a wide variety of products, from clothing to furnitue via household appliances and 
        cars. However, if the item you’re looking for isn’t available, you can create a group with other users 
        interested in the same product. This enables you to organize a bulk order and lower the costs. The Souk
        is, above all, a space for exchange and collaboration among its users.
